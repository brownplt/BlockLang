* DONE First, switch to my list implementation. 
* TODO Add in test cases for user-defined functions. 
* TODO Then spend a day on code generation, so that we can have a representative sample of blocks to play with  
* TODO Figure out how I want to represent types. 

Spend a day getting code generation working on a representative sample.
Build my own immutable list data structures. 
Feel free to have types be associated with arguments.
