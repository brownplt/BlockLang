When dragging blocks with rest arguments, the rest arguments revert to unknown color, they're fine if I add or remove arguments, but initially they do have this problem.

Update signature language to read more like natural language
*** DONE 
X to remove argument
*** DONE 
Fix list block, so that it typechecks correctly (basically, I just have to special case this in the typechecker, and provide the appropriate constraints).

*** DONE 
Have run button disabled when viewing invalid workspace
*** DONE 
Have run button text and tooltip change appropriately

* Remaining Tasks
** High Priority [0/18]
*** TODO [#A] 
Double clicking is like using a repl, and is immediate evaluation, while running a program is the formal version which triggers tests to be run. (Even if you don't use something, all the tests should be run) I currently have the UI in place for double clicking, but haven't hooked it up to evaluation.
*** TODO [#A]
Have failed tests change color to red upon failure, and successful ones to turn green upon success, and then have a tooltip that explains what went wrong that is active over the whole area of the test block. Have a tab change color as well if there are failing tests in the tab. I have everything here but the tooltip on the test block with an explanation of what went wrong.
*** TODO [#A]
Have unfinished definitions work gracefully  
*** TODO [#B]
When you change a function and that causes type error, make the block that doesn't fit turn red or something, and then also have the workspaces which use that block turn red as well
*** TODO [#A]
Add in image atomic type. !!
*** TODO [#B]
Add support for world-programming, via big-bang primitives. !!
*** TODO [#A]
Test adding so many functions that the tab bar is longer than the screen width 
*** TODO [#A]
Get function body displayable in pop-up alongside function usage !!
*** TODO [#A]
Make it possible to define a value by right-clicking, saying "Name a value" (Not inside functions) !!
*** TODO [#C]
Hook up to WeScheme !! I have accounts working, and need to add the interface elements for listing programs. 
*** TODO [#A]
Make failed attempts to connect react more violently to that failure. Maybe have block to which you can't connect get repelled!
*** TODO [#A]
Make drop targets for blocks larger, so that it's easier to connect them.
*** TODO [#A]
Default type of argument should be blank.
*** TODO [#A]
Test it on iPad !!
*** TODO [#A]
Make signature easier to open when closed
*** TODO [#B]
Move example block to next line, and add the word "For" in front so it reads "For example..."
*** TODO [#C]
Pull latest version of Blockly
*** TODO [#A]
Provide support for undoing any action !!

** Low Priority [0/38]
*** TODO
Switch to rounded rectangles. Merge this with notch shape
*** TODO
Change unknown color to rainbow gradient.
*** TODO
Move the button to open function editing dialog to the signature
*** TODO
Make it possible to define a value by right-clicking, saying "Name a value" (Inside functions)
*** TODO
Every time there is a bug, set it up to send me an email.
*** TODO
Inside function definition dialog, you should be able to drag a name and type into the signature to add an argument.
*** TODO
Have flyout automatically refresh when I switch tabs, so that I get most up to date set of blocks.
*** TODO
Disable copying of argument blocks from one function to another. (Actually just allow, and throw error if you use an undefined variable)
*** TODO
See about having function body not just floating in space. (Don't worry about this, just throw an error if they try to run and there are multiple expressions that could be the body)
*** TODO
Build up support for vertical layouts, and convert 'if' and 'cond' to use vertical layouts.
*** TODO
Remove dependency on jQuery. Not necessarily worth the hassle, it's also only used in testing.
*** TODO
Start getting compiled mode to work.
*** TODO
Color toolbar items, according to type.
*** TODO
Figure out why drawers get confused sometimes. 
*** TODO
Rename 'unknown' to 'misc'. 
*** TODO
In funtion creation dialog, arguments names should be colored according to their type. Same with function name. 
*** TODO
Ordering for evaluation of multiple expressions in main workspace.
*** TODO
Figure out how to handle unfinished function definitions
*** TODO
Make pasting happen at cursor, not just at location of copy
*** TODO
Use DragLists to handle re-ordering arguments
*** TODO
Put 'example' block in forms
*** TODO
Figure out interface for removing/changing values
*** TODO
Require at least one argument for functions
*** TODO
Make purpose statement area much larger (input -> textarea)
*** TODO
Have individual items in the function definition dialog turn green when valid, and red otherwise, with localized error messages
*** TODO
Unify tooltips to have consistent styling
*** TODO
Unify tooltips to also use the same mechanism everywhere (not the case currently), so that I could switch to a message bar if desired
*** TODO
Provide some sort of feedback when you run tests, and there are none
*** TODO
Have results be shown as blocks
*** TODO
Figure out how to serialize everything
*** TODO
Add a 'list' category
*** TODO
See if we need 'unknown' after that
*** TODO
Add support for evaluating expressions within the body (have students provide values for the arguments / or just disallow this)
*** TODO
Have the signature return when you let go of the block you are holding
*** TODO
Have the signature not part of the canvas, so you can't drag things onto it.
*** TODO
Give name and purpose textfield/area in funDefDialog each a full line
*** TODO
Precede each line in FunDefDialog with label in bold. ("Name:", "Purpose:", "Domain:", "Range:")
*** TODO
