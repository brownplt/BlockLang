* DONE First, switch to my list implementation. 
* DONE Add in test cases for user-defined functions. 
* TODO Then spend a day on code generation, so that we can have a representative sample of blocks to play with  
- I also have to put an instance of Ray in place on the page, so I can use that, and I have to get the code generation working!
- First, figure out how to generate blocks from calls to builtins. Basically,
  look at type. If Primitive or Closure, match argument spec to determine
  inputs. Otherwise, make an inner field for props. This will work
  nicely with typing. 
* TODO Figure out how I want to represent types. 
- Feel free to have types be associated with arguments.
