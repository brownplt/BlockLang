* How to get started:

** Ray

Ray is the top-level namespace for everything I've written. I chose the name because it was short, matched the Marine Wildlife theme established by Whalesong,
and also was close to Racket.

** Application

You have to start up a server to run the application.
I'm just using python's builtin HTTP server, so as long as you have some python installation in your PATH, this should work.

You can do so with the following command:

./start-server

Run that from the root directory of the repository, and then navigate to

http://localhost:8000/ray/ui/ui_demo.html

to run the application.

** Tests
The test suite for Ray can be run and viewed by opening up
'ray/tests.html' in a web browser. No server is required.

 If not using a server, you do need to provide the full path to the file in order to view it in the browser.

 If you'd like, you can run a server, with './start-server', and then view the page at

 http://localhost:8000/ray/tests.html
